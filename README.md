# Game Design 2 Starting Project
This is the starting project for Game Design 2 at Wichita State University. It is intended to include everything that was completed in Game Design 1.

[Notes on FMOD integration](https://gist.github.com/brianisbrilliant/b9a15cb337bbb82208a18a5220611b6d).

This project requires that you install the FMOD plugin that matches your OS and version of Unreal Engine. You can [download the correct plugin here](https://www.fmod.com/download). Then extract the downloaded files into the Plugins folder of the project. [Official instructions are here](https://www.fmod.com/docs/2.02/unreal/user-guide.html#installing-the-integration).

For MacOS Users, We coudl not get 5.2 to work, but Unreal 5.3 works great.
